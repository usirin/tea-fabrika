# 6. Can Jev tell whether a test checks a criterion?

`06-test-check-calibration.ts`, 54 hand-built tests, 324 answers. New question:
"would this test passing show the criterion is met?"

Each criterion got two honest tests and four bad ones: named after the
criterion but checking something else, the wrong expected value, related but
passing either way, and asserting nothing. A test counts as good only if it
passes on the correct code and fails on the code that breaks its criterion. The
script stops if a label disagrees with the run.

- At 0.9 and up: right 200 of 200.
- All 4 confident misses sat at 0.80 to 0.81. It accepted a bad test each time.
- It never confidently refused a good test, but at a 0.8 floor 41% of good
  tests came back unsure.
- Showing the same checks as sentences instead of code made no difference.
  (This only shows Jev reads both forms equally well. It is not experiment 5.)
- 4 of 18 good tests already pass on the starting code, because it returns
  `null` and the criterion expects `null`. So "a new test must fail first"
  cannot be a hard rule.

**Took from it:** this question works, and wants a higher floor than 0.8.
