# Experiment log

What we tried, what came back, and what we took from it. Newest last. Every
number here came from a real run against Jev and, where it says so, Claude Code.
The samples are small and the two toys are tiny, so read these as hints, not
proof.

Guesses that turned out wrong are left in on purpose.

## The setup

Two toys under `fixtures/`: `slugify` (three rules) and `duration`
(`parseDuration`, six rules). `toys.ts` holds, for each toy, one correct
implementation and several broken on purpose, each breaking one criterion. That
is what gives a case a known answer: run the real tests and see.

Jev is a small classifier. It answers a multiple-choice question about some
JSON and returns a confidence between 0 and 1. The lane acts on an answer only
when the confidence is at or above a floor.

## 1. Is Jev's low confidence just noise?

`criterion-clarity.mjs`

Asking the same question four times gave 0.69, 0.79, 0.64, 0.77. That looked
like noise. It was not. Low confidence followed bad input every time we looked:

- a criterion that contradicted the code or another criterion
- a criterion about what stayed the same (the judge only sees changed lines)
- a thin ticket

**Took from it:** when the judge is unsure, fix what it was asked, do not ask
again. So an unsure verdict should go back to triage, which owns the wording.

## 2. Tell the enricher how the judge reads

`src/claude.ts`, `JUDGE_BRIEF`

The enricher (the agent that rewrites a raw ticket) was told how its criteria
get judged: one claim each, about what the change makes true, never about what
is left untouched.

**Result:** slugify went from 0 of 3 runs finishing to 5 of 5.

## 3. Show the judge the passing tests

The judge was first shown only the diff. Adding the names of the tests that
passed took `duration-open` from 0 of 5 runs finishing to 8 of 10.

`judge-rubber-stamp.mjs` checked the worry that it would now say "met" to
anything with green tests. It did not: for a criterion that was not done and
had no test, it said "not met" at 0.99.

## 4. How often is the judge right at each confidence?

`judge-calibration.ts`, 87 cases, 261 answers. Question: "does this change
satisfy this criterion?"

| Confidence | Right |
|---|---|
| 0.8 and up | 218 of 221 |
| 0.7 to 0.8 | 11 of 12 |
| under 0.7 | about half |

Split by what the judge was shown:

| Shown | Right |
|---|---|
| A passing test for the criterion | 117 of 117 |
| No test, code is correct | 95% |
| No test, code is broken | about half |

The broken-and-untested group includes one case answered "met" at 0.93 to 0.95
three times in a row.

**Took from it:** the 0.8 floor is fine for this question. The weak spot is a
criterion with no test. So the rule became: every criterion needs a test.

## 5. Can Jev stand in for running the test?

The idea: write the test in prose and let Jev judge the code against it, with
nothing run. Experiment 4 had already covered most of this, because the
duration criteria carry an example each (`"1.5h"` returns `5400`), which makes
them prose tests in all but name.

Broken code, no test shown:

| Criteria | Answers | Sure and right | Sure and wrong | Unsure |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| With an example (duration) | 18 | 8 | 0 | 10 |
| Abstract (slugify) | 9 | 3 | 3 | 3 |

**Took from it:** with a concrete example Jev never confidently passed broken
code, but it confidently caught the bug less than half the time. A real test
run catches it every time. Small sample.

## 6. Can Jev tell whether a test checks a criterion?

`test-check-calibration.ts`, 54 hand-built tests, 324 answers. New question:
"would this test passing show the criterion is met?"

Each criterion got two honest tests and four bad ones: named after the
criterion but checking something else, the wrong expected value, related but
passing either way, and asserting nothing. A test counts as good only if it
passes on the correct code and fails on the code that breaks its criterion. The
script stops if a label disagrees with the run.

- At 0.9 and up: right 200 of 200.
- All 4 confident misses sat at 0.80 to 0.81. It accepted a bad test each time.
- It never confidently refused a good test, but at a 0.8 floor 41% of good
  tests came back unsure.
- Showing the same checks as sentences instead of code made no difference.
  (This only shows Jev reads both forms equally well. It is not experiment 5.)
- 4 of 18 good tests already pass on the starting code, because it returns
  `null` and the criterion expects `null`. So "a new test must fail first"
  cannot be a hard rule.

**Took from it:** this question works, and wants a higher floor than 0.8.

## 7. Can an agent write the tests first?

`test-writer.ts`. Claude got the starting code and the criteria, and wrote
tests. It never saw an implementation or the toy's own tests. Graded the same
hard way as experiment 6.

First run, six turns: 27 of 27 criteria got a good test. At a 0.9 floor the
judge let 17 through and was unsure on 10, all of them good.

**Took from it:** the writer is not the weak part. The judge's caution is.

## 8. Does an example in the criterion fix the caution?

Guess: the judge is unsure when the criterion is abstract, so add a worked
example to each.

**Wrong.** 3 of 9 slugify tests passed the judge with the old wording, 3 of 9
with the new. The writer picked its own inputs and ignored the example, and it
split the two-claim criterion ("punctuation and accented letters") into two
tests.

`fit-probe.ts` asked Jev about that one criterion several ways:

| What Jev was shown | Confidence |
|---|---|
| Two claims, two tests together | 0.44 to 0.54 |
| Two claims, one test covering both | 0.76 to 0.83 |
| One claim, its test | 0.82 to 0.87 |
| One claim with an example, test asserts that example | 0.90 to 0.92 |

**Took from it:** it is the whole chain that matters. One claim per criterion,
one test per criterion, and the test asserts the criterion's own example.

## 9. The three rules, given to the writer

The writer was told: exactly one test per criterion; when the criterion gives
an example, assert exactly that; add a second assertion only when the first
would pass on code that does nothing. Twelve turns.

All 48 criteria got a good test, and none passed on the starting code: for
"returns null" criteria the writer added a check that a valid input parses.

Tests the judge let through:

| Criteria | Floor 0.9 | Floor 0.85 |
|---|---|---|
| slugify, as first written | 3 of 9 | 4 of 9 |
| slugify, example added | 3 of 9 | 9 of 9 |
| slugify, one claim each with an example | 6 of 12 | 12 of 12 |
| duration | 10 of 18 | 14 of 18 |

Confidence went up across the board, but it bunches at 0.86 to 0.89, just under
the 0.9 floor.

On the hand-built tests of experiment 6, a 0.85 floor would have accepted 0 bad
tests out of 216 answers, the same as 0.9. That floor was picked after seeing
the data, so it needs a fresh set of bad tests before anyone trusts it.

## 10. Bad tests written to fool the judge

`bad-tests.ts`. The 0.85 floor was picked after seeing the data, so it needed
bad tests it had not been tuned on. Claude was asked to write tests that look
honest and are not, aimed at a reviewer who skims: an input that almost
exercises the rule, an expected value that is nearly right, an assertion that
is slightly too loose. Each had to fail on the starting code, so running it
first would not give it away.

90 tests came back. Running them settled which were really bad: 56 were (34
fail on correct code, 22 pass on code that breaks the criterion). In the other
34 the adversary slipped and wrote a test that does check its criterion.

Each test was shown to the judge three times:

| Floor | Bad accepted | Bad refused | Bad unsure |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.80 | 0 of 168 | 60 | 108 |
| 0.85 | 0 of 168 | 43 | 125 |
| 0.90 | 0 of 168 | 28 | 140 |

The judge did say "checks" to bad tests, but never with confidence. The
highest was 0.79, for a test that expected `"mcdonald-s-menu"` from
`"McDonald's Menu"`.

**Took from it:** 0.85 holds on a fresh set, with a margin of 0.06 over the
worst miss. 0.80 held too, but by 0.01, and it failed in experiment 6. Unsure is
the judge's usual answer to a bad test, so "unsure" must send the test back,
never wave it through.

One limit: "bad" here means bad against one broken version of the code per
criterion. A test could pass that check and still be too weak in another way.

## 11. Do hidden tests catch code that only learned the examples?

`hidden-tests.ts`. One visible test per criterion, asserting the criterion's
own example, leaves a hole: code can pass by handling just those inputs. Think
of a student who memorised the practice questions. The fix under test is the
teacher's: set different questions in the exam. The test-writer writes a second
file of tests with other inputs, which the builder never sees.

Claude wrote both files, three runs per toy. The cheats were written by hand,
eleven of them: a lookup table of the examples, lower-casing only the first
letter, collapsing exactly three spaces, removing only the punctuation seen in
the examples, and so on.

- 33 of 36 cheats passed every visible test. The hole is real: the lane as
  planned would have called all 33 done.
- Hidden tests caught 24 of the 33. slugify: 15 of 15. duration: 9 of 18.
- 0 of 90 hidden tests failed on the correct code, so none would have blocked
  an honest builder.

The 9 misses are three cheats, missed in every run, and all three break the
same thing: the seconds unit. No criterion mentions seconds. The writer was
told to test nothing the criteria do not promise, and it did not. Counting only
cheats against a rule some criterion states, hidden tests caught 24 of 24.

The judge is no use on hidden tests: at 0.85 it let through 8 of 90, all of
them sound. It is sure when a test uses the criterion's example, and a hidden
test by design does not.

**Took from it:** hidden tests close the "learned the examples" hole for rules
the ticket states. They cannot cover a rule the ticket never wrote down; that
is a gap in the criteria, and triage's to close. And hidden tests go unjudged,
so a wrong one would block a builder who cannot see why. None was wrong here.

## 12. The enricher's own criteria

`enricher-criteria.ts`. Every run so far used criteria written by hand. Here
the front of the lane runs on the raw ticket ("slugs look wrong"): the enricher
writes the criteria, the test-writer writes the tests, the judge reads them.
The enricher is now told to write one claim per criterion with a worked
example. Three runs per toy, 43 criteria.

- Every criterion came back as one claim with an example, bar one.
- All 43 tests were sound: none wrong on correct code, none already passing on
  the starting code, none missing.
- The judge at 0.85 let through 31 of 43: duration 26 of 27, slugify 5 of 16.
- The tests caught 27 of 33 broken versions: slugify 15 of 15, duration 12 of 18.

Two things went wrong, and both trace back to what we told the agents.

**The enricher dropped two real rules.** Every duration run left out "units out
of order return null" and "an unknown unit returns null". Those are the 6
broken versions nobody caught. The likely cause is our own instruction: never
write a criterion whose test would pass before any code is written. The
starting code returns `null` for everything, so the enricher left the `null`
rules out. A rule made to keep empty tests out pushed real requirements out.

**The ticket title moves the judge.** The same slugify criterion and test that
scored 0.94 to 0.98 with hand-written input scored 0.55 to 0.80 here.
`title-probe.ts` isolates it, four answers each:

| Title shown with the criterion and test | Confidence |
|---|---|
| States the goal: "slugify turns a title into a URL slug" | 0.93 to 0.97 |
| States the bug: "slugify returns the title unchanged instead of a URL-safe slug" | 0.58 to 0.84 |
| No title | 0.65 to 0.79 |

The enricher writes bug-shaped titles, because that is what a ticket title
usually is. The judge needs to know what the thing is for.

**Took from it:** show the judge a one-line goal, not the ticket title. And the
"must fail first" rule belongs to the test, not the criterion: a rule that is
already true of the starting code still gets a criterion, and its test fails
first by also asserting a case that works.

## 13. Both fixes, and a third problem they uncovered

Fix one: the enricher is told that a rule the finished code must follow gets a
criterion even when the starting code follows it by accident. Fix two: the
enricher writes a one-line goal, and the judge sees that instead of the title.

Fix one worked outright. The enricher wrote 63 criteria instead of 43, the
`null` rules came back, all 63 tests were sound, and the tests caught 33 of 33
broken versions (up from 27).

Fix two made things worse at first: the judge let through 15 of 63. The
enricher's goal line is long and lists the rules ("a lower-case, dash-separated
slug made only of a-z, 0-9 and dashes"), and the judge held each test to all of
it. A test of one rule looked too small. Same criterion and test, four answers
each:

| Shown beside the criterion and test | Confidence |
|---|---|
| Short line, under the key `issue` | 0.92 to 0.94 |
| Long line, under the key `issue` | 0.67 to 0.84 |
| Long line, under the key `goal` | 0.30 to 0.36 |
| Long line, under the key `about`, and the question says it is background only | 0.85 to 0.90 |

So the question now says: "`about` only says what the code is for. Judge the
test against `criterion` alone." (`questionsWithAbout` in `fit.ts`.)

`refit-bad-tests.ts` put the reworded question to the saved bad tests of
experiment 10: still 0 of 168 accepted at 0.80, 0.85 and 0.90, worst 0.79.

Rerun with the reworded question:

- The judge let through 39 of 63: duration 31 of 42, slugify 8 of 21.
- Every one of the other 24 was a sound test the judge answered "checks" to,
  just under the floor, bar one "does not check" at 0.26.
- The tests for `null` rules score lowest. They carry a second assertion, so
  that they fail on the starting code, and the judge reads a two-assertion test
  with less confidence.

**Took from it:** the judge is safe (it has not accepted a bad test at 0.85 in
any run) and touchy (wording of the question, the key a field sits under, and
the length of a background line each move it by 0.1 to 0.6). On criteria and
tests written by agents it passes about six good tests in ten. The other four
need somewhere to go that is not a person.

## 14. Is there more in the answer than one confidence number?

`decision-rule.ts`. Jev gives every option a share: checks, does_not_check,
cannot_tell. The hope: a good test the judge is unsure about has its doubt in
"cannot tell", a bad one in "does not check", and a rule on the shares would
let more good tests through for free.

**No.** "Cannot tell" gets a share of about 0 on good and bad tests alike, so
the answer is one number in practice. Jev's docs give the formula: confidence
is the top share rescaled, `(p_max - 1/n) / (1 - 1/n)` for `n` options. Our
0.85 floor on three options is a top share of 0.90.

The rerun did add 618 answers to the record. Bad tests accepted at 0.85: 0 of
273. The closest was 0.83, for a test expecting 8010 from `"2H15M"` (the right
answer is 8100). Jev does not do arithmetic, so the margin over the floor is
thin: 0.02.

## 15. Reading Jev's own guide

After fourteen experiments we read the docs properly
(https://docs.typesafe.ai/concepts/how-to-build-with-system-one). By their
measure we are using Jev the hard way:

- "Ask the most explicit, narrow, specific, atomic questions you can." They
  call this the most important idea in the guide. We ask one broad question:
  would this test passing show the criterion is met?
- "Ask many narrow, independent questions about the same state in one
  request." Questions in one call run in parallel, so splitting costs no extra
  round trip. We ask one question per call.
- "Give each question only the context it needs." Experiments 12 and 13 are
  that rule learned the slow way: a title, then a goal line, each moved the
  answer.
- There is a yes/no question type (`noul`) and a rubric type (`score`). We
  have only used `choice`.
- An option's description can say what it covers, what it does not, and give
  examples. Ours are one sentence each.
- "Combine independent answers with deterministic rules" in code.

What we did beyond the guide: measured how often each confidence level is
right, on cases with known answers, and tried to fool it.

## Open

- Split the one broad question into narrow yes/no ones (same input as the
  criterion's example? same expected result? an exact comparison?) and combine
  them in code. Untried, and it is what the guide says to do first.
- If a criterion's example were data (a call and its result) and not prose,
  code could write the visible test and nobody would need to judge it.
- The judge sends back about four good tests in ten. Asking the writer again
  will mostly give the same test. Where do they go: a stronger judge, a reworded
  criterion, or a lower floor for answers that are "checks"?
- Who checks a hidden test, if the judge cannot? Running it against nothing
  proves nothing, and the builder cannot see it to object.
- A rule the ticket never states (seconds, in the duration toy) is tested by
  nobody. Can triage be made to notice it?
- The cheats were written by hand. A builder that cheats on its own may do it
  differently.
- None of this has run end to end: write tests, judge them, build, run.

## Running them

Each script needs `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`. `test-writer.ts` also needs the `claude`
CLI. Results land in `results/`; a rerun overwrites them, so earlier numbers
are in the git history.
