# 1. Is Jev's low confidence just noise?

`01-criterion-clarity.mjs`

Asking the same question four times gave 0.69, 0.79, 0.64, 0.77. That looked
like noise. It was not. Low confidence followed bad input every time we looked:

- a criterion that contradicted the code or another criterion
- a criterion about what stayed the same (the judge only sees changed lines)
- a thin ticket

**Took from it:** when the judge is unsure, fix what it was asked, do not ask
again. So an unsure verdict should go back to triage, which owns the wording.
